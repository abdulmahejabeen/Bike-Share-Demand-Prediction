# Bike-Share-Demand-Prediction-and-Rebalancing
The project aims to address the challenges arising from rapid growth of metropolitan areas and the increasing need for bike-sharing programs. The project objective is to predict the demand for bike share using a variety of machine learning regression models and also to provide an intelligent infrastructure for bike stations that leverages reinforcement learning to expedite the rebalancing procedure.

## Dataset Description
The datasets consists of hourly bike rentals count on a daily basis along with aspects of weather information like temperature, humidity, wind speed, visibility, dewpoint, solar radiation, snowfall, and rainfall, and information about the season, holiday, and functioning day which are the features and the target variable is the number of bikes rented per hour and date information.

## Community Contribution
The rise in on-road vehicles and traffic congestion underscores the need for reliable transportation options. Through the utilization of bike-sharing systems, our goal is to alleviate traffic congestion, decrease Greenhouse Gas Emissions, and advocate for a healthier and eco-friendly mode of transportation.
