# Bike-Share-Demand-Prediction-and-Rebalancing
The project aims to address the challenges arising from rapid growth of metropolitan areas and the increasing need for bike-sharing programs. The project objective is to predict the demand for bike share using a variety of machine learning regression models and also to provide an intelligent infrastructure for bike stations that leverages reinforcement learning to expedite the rebalancing procedure.

## Contribution to the society
The rise in on-road vehicles and traffic congestion underscores the need for reliable transportation options. Through the utilization of bike-sharing systems, our goal is to alleviate traffic congestion, decrease Greenhouse Gas Emissions, and advocate for a healthier and eco-friendly mode of transportation.
